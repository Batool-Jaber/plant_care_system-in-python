# 🌱 Smart Plant Care & Health Monitoring System (PRO)

An advanced **classical computer vision project** for analyzing plant leaf health using image processing techniques — without deep learning.

This system detects plant health conditions by analyzing color, texture, and structural features from a single leaf image, then provides an interpretable health score and visual explanations.
